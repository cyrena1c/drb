A command line tool for reading and studying the Word of God from your
terminal.  Douay--Rheims with Challoner revision.

Inspired by
- https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/vul
and 
- https://github.com/bontibon/kjv
but I decided to rewrite pretty much from scratch to include the notes and
to make it look nicer especially on Termux/Android.

Requires dos2unix, ed, groff, and tput.  Untested on non-GNU POSIX.

Some notes:-
- Currently only shows one chapter at a time.
- Do not expose this to a public network.  The scripts are not written
    with security in mind.
- Defaults to USCCB abbreviations---Gn not Gen.  Add your own aliases to
    drb_aliases.txt .
- 1Sm opens up "The First Book of Samuel (The First Book of Kings)"
- 1Kgs opens up "The Third (First) Book of Kings"
- Psalms are numbered according to LXX.
- Book prefaces are still WIP.  Most of them will appear at the end of
    the preceding book.
